            <h3>Dancing Studio</h3><br>
            <!--some text to give a general message of what the site is about and balanced with the two images-->
            <p>Our studio was founded more than a decade by a few dancing lovers.
                Throughout the years we have become one of the most well-known studio in Ireland.
                This succes lies in several pillars that are key for us:</p><br>

            <p>Quality: All our teachers are qualified and have a long experience of dancing. Some of them took part in
                international competition.</p><br>

            <p>Dancing experience: As practise makes perfect, you will be dancing from day one and step by step you will
                master the basics of the dance you chose.</p><br>

            <p>Fun environment: Since the beginning, you will enjoy dancing. Our methodology is quite unique. Indeed, at
                some point you will be playing games. This is a way for us to digest the technique and improving your
                learning experience.</p><br>

            <p>On the other hand, dancing is an art but also a wonderful activity which will bring benefits to your
                life:</p><br>

            <p>- Your coordination will improve.
            <p><br>
            <p>- A better self-confidence.</p><br>
            <p>- Meeting new friends.</p><br>
            <p>- Losing calories in a funny way.</p><br>
            <p>- improving your stamina</p><br>

            <p>Now, it is your turn! Come to visit us and ask our lovely staff about our different dances.</p><br>

            <p>You will definitely find something that will catch your interest and note as well that the first class is
                free so that you can make your decision afterwards</p><br>

            <p>So, what are you waiting for? Let's dance!</p>
