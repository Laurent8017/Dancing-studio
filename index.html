            <p>Our studio was founded more than a decade by a few dancing lovers.
                Throughout the years we have become one of the most well-known studio in Ireland.
                This succes lies in several pillars that are key for us:
            </p>
            <p>Quality: All our teachers are qualified and have a long experience of dancing. Some of them took part in
                international competition.
            </p>
            <p>Dancing experience: As practise makes perfect, you will be dancing from day one and step by step you will
                master the basics of the dance you chose.
            </p>
            <p>Fun environment: Since the beginning, you will enjoy dancing. Our methodology is quite unique. Indeed,
                at
                some point you will be playing games. This is a way for us to digest the technique and improving your
                learning experience.
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, dancing is an art but also a wonderful activity which will bring benefits to your
                life:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>- Your coordination will improve.</li>
                <li>- A better self-confidence.</li>
                <li>- Meeting new friends.</li>
                <li>- Losing calories in a funny way.</li>
                <li>- improving your stamina</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Now, it is your turn! Come to visit us and ask our lovely staff about our different dances.
                You will definitely find something that will catch your interest and note as well that the first class
                is
                free so that you can make your decision afterwards
                So, what are you waiting for? Let's dance!
