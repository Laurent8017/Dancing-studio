# DANCING STUDIO

Dancing Studio is a website meeting the criteria for responsiveness as the information can be seen on a large range of devices. 
Then, it aims at informing people about a place where they can learn dancing in Dublin.
There are different styles of dances organized by levels to make the most of the lessons. 

Users can find the studio on social media and at the physical address. Then, they can also leave their details on the registration form and the type of dances and levels they are interested in.
